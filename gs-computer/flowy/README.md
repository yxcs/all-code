## Features
Currently, Flowy supports the following:

 - Responsive drag and drop
 - Automatic snapping
 - Block rearrangement
 - Delete blocks
 - Automatic block centering
 
 You can try out [the demo](https://alyssax.com/x/flowy) to see the library in action.
 

## Installation
Adding Flowy to your WebApp is incredibly simple:
1. Include jQuery to your project
2. Link `flowy.min.js` and `flowy.min.css` to your project

## Running Flowy

### Initialization
```javascript
flowy(canvas, ongrab, onrelease, onsnap, spacing_x, spacing_y);
```

Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `canvas` | *jQuery object* | The element that will contain the blocks 
   `ongrab` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when a block is dragged
   `onrelease` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when a block is released
   `onsnap` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when a block snaps with another one
   `spacing_x` | *integer* (optional) |  Horizontal spacing between blocks (default 20px)
   `spacing_Y` | *integer* (optional) |  Vertical spacing between blocks (default 80px)

To define the blocks that can be dragged, you need to add the class `.create-flowy`

### Example
**HTML**
```html
<div class="create-flowy">The block to be dragged</div>
<div id="canvas"></div>
```
**Javascript**
```javascript
var spacing_x = 40;
var spacing_y = 100;
// Initialize Flowy
flowy($("#canvas"), onGrab, onRelease, onSnap, spacing_x, spacing_y);
function onGrab(){
	// When the user grabs a block
}
function onRelease(){
	// When the user releases a block
}
function onSnap(){
	// When a block snaps with another one
}
```
## Methods
### Get the flowchart data
```javascript
// As an object
flowy.output();
// As a JSON string
JSON.stringify(flowy.output());
```
The JSON object that gets outputted looks like this:
```javascript
{
	"id": 1,
	"parent": 0,
	"data": [
		{
		"name": "blockid",
		"value": "1"
		}
	]
}
```

Here's what each property means:

Key | Value type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `id` | *integer* | Unique value that identifies a block 
   `parent` | *integer* |  The `id` of the parent a block is attached to (-1 means the block has no parent)
   `data` | *array of objects* |  An array of all the inputs within the selected block
   `name` | *string* |  The name attribute of the input
   `value` | *string* |  The value attribute of the input

### Delete all blocks
To remove all blocks at once use:
```javascript
flowy.deleteBlocks()
```
Currently there is no method to individually remove blocks. The only way to go about it is by splitting branches manually.
